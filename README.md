# DebugLogConsole
A mod for Subnautica that adds a Debug Console ingame and in a CMD window for Modders

Use F12 to spawn the Console in the game.

AutoError automatically brings the Console up if an error has occured.

Draggable allows you to drag the window across the screen.

Resize allows to change the size of the Log. (Note disable draggable to prevent bugs.)

Collapse messages combines multiple same messages into a single message.
